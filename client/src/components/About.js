            The first Crown Burgers restaurant was opened in 1978 by John & Rula Katzourakis and Nick Katsanevas (Rula’s brother).  Later Nick Katsanevas was bought out and now currently owns a Crown Burger at another location with his family.
  The first location was in the parking lot of the current 377 East 200 South location.  It seated 75 people.  John worked from 3 a.m. to 5 p.m. doing all of the prep work for the homemade Onion Rings and Chili.  Within 30 days, people were lined up like a train outside the front door, waiting to come in. The original building was torn down 1½ years later and the current building was built, seating 150 people.
  Our menu started with about 65 items and now we serve up to 100 different items such as burgers, French Fries, Homemade Onion Rings, Dinners, Salads, Fish, Chicken, and a little Greek, such as Gyros, Souvlakia with Tzatziki sauce, and Lemon Rice or a Greek Salad.  We also serve Hot or Cold sandwiches.  All condiments and Salads are prepared fresh daily.  Burgers are cooked and prepared in the front counter grills and fryers and our customers love to watch their food being made before their eyes.

  Our most popular sandwich and also our signature sandwich is the “Crown Burger” named after our establishment.  It is a quarter pound hamburger patty on a sesame seed bun with Thousand Island dressing, Lettuce, Tomato, and Onions, Cheese, and topped with lots of Hot Juicy Pastrami.  It is a must for first time customers.  It was sold by John Katzourakis and Jim Katsanevas in California at “Minos Burgers.” We sold only 2-4 per day, now it has become our Super Seller at our Utah Crown Burger locations.

  Our customers are always our #1 priority, as is quality and great service.  We always aim to please.  Orders are made to all different cravings.  We love our customers and we want them coming back again and again.  We feel like family with so many of our customers and some have become personal and close friends.

  In all of the Crown Burger locations you will always find 1 to 5 family members working along side of our employees.  Some of the restaurants may differ with 1-2 different items or different prices, but you will always find the Best, freshest food and friendliest service in all of our Crown Burger locations.
